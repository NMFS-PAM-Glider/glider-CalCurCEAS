# glider-CalCurCEAS

Repository for passive acoustic glider efforts overlapping with CalCurCEAS (California Current Cetacean and Ecosystem Assessment Survey) 2024. This project is part of NOAA's [IRA PAM Strategic Initiative](https://nmfs-ost.github.io/PAM_National_NMFS_Network/content/SI_Coordination.html) and IRA UxS Strategic Initiative. 

This repository contains survey planning and analysis documentation and code. 
Glider piloting files, raw acoustic files, and large analysis outputs *should not* be stored here.
